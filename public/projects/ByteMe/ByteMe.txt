ByteMe – Applying fintech thinking to nutrition

ByteMe is a native iOS nutrition tracker that borrows patterns from financial monitoring—turning daily food logging into a clean, insight-driven experience. I built it both as a real health tool I use every day and as a sandbox to prototype ideas for personal finance monitoring: frictionless entry, trend visualization, and habit-forming feedback loops.

What it is: A Swift/SwiftUI iOS app for logging meals, tracking macros/micros, and visualizing nutrition trends over time.

Why it matters: It lets me test and refine monitoring patterns (data entry, dashboards, goals) in a health context, then port the best ideas back into my work on financial monitoring.

My role: Principal PM + iOS dev — product strategy, UX flows, system architecture, and implementation.

Status: Live personal app, evolving toward deeper integrations with Apple Health, Apple Watch, and Whoop.

Project Detail Page
Overview

ByteMe is a personal nutrition monitoring app that brings financial monitoring patterns into the health space.

On the surface, it’s a clean, simple iOS app for logging meals and tracking nutrition. Under the hood, it’s a deliberate experiment in:

How to make complex data feel approachable

How to design monitoring workflows that people actually stick with

How to build an app that can later plug into richer health ecosystems (Apple Health, Apple Watch, Whoop)

I use ByteMe daily both to manage my own nutrition and as a sandbox for ideas that I can transfer back into my work on personal finance monitoring.

Type: Native iOS app (nutrition monitoring)

Role: Product, design, and implementation

Stack: Swift, SwiftUI, local persistence + cloud sync; designed for HealthKit / Watch / Whoop integrations

Status: Actively used; integration roadmap in progress

Problem & Inspiration

Working on a personal finance monitoring product, I spend a lot of time thinking about:

How people enter data (or avoid it)

How they scan dashboards

How they interpret trends and set goals

What actually drives behavior change

While evaluating other tools across domains, I noticed something:

Health tracking apps often feel more intuitive and human-friendly than their financial counterparts—even though both deal with time-series data, goals, and personal outcomes.

The parallels between money and nutrition are obvious:

Regular data entry → logs, transactions, meals

Ongoing monitoring → balances, budgets, calorie/macro counts

Trend analysis → spending patterns vs eating patterns

Goals & progress → savings targets vs weight / performance / health goals

So I asked:

“What if I built a health app that lets me test monitoring patterns for finance—while also giving me something genuinely useful in my day-to-day life?”

ByteMe is that app:

A testing ground for UX and systems ideas I care about professionally

A real tool I use to manage what I eat and how it impacts how I feel

What ByteMe Does Today

ByteMe focuses on being frictionless to log and easy to understand. It avoids trying to be “everything health” and instead goes deep on nutrition.

Core Capabilities

Meal Logging

Quickly log meals and snacks throughout the day.

Capture essential data like foods, quantities, and meal times.

Designed to be fast enough that logging doesn’t feel like a separate task.

Nutrition Tracking

Track macronutrients (protein, carbs, fats) and key micronutrients, depending on available data.

Aggregate intake by meal, day, and longer time periods.

Patterns & Trends

Simple visualizations that highlight:

Daily intake vs goals

Consistency over time

Emerging patterns (e.g., under-eating protein, late-night calorie spikes)

Emphasis on clarity over complexity—enough data to be useful, not enough to overwhelm.

Goals & Progress

Set nutrition-related targets (e.g., daily protein, calories, macros balance).

Track how often and how well you’re hitting those goals.

Reinforce habit formation by making progress feel visible and attainable.

The result is an app that’s lean but effective: quick to use, informative enough to change behavior, and structured around daily use instead of one-off experiments.

Future Roadmap

The next phase for ByteMe is deeper integration into the broader health ecosystem, so nutrition isn’t viewed in isolation.

1. Apple Health Integration

Sync nutrition data into Apple Health for a holistic health record.

Pull activity data (steps, exercise, energy expenditure) to connect what you eat to how you move.

Enable cross-app data sharing, so ByteMe doesn’t have to do everything itself; it can coexist with other health and fitness apps.

2. Apple Watch Companion App

Quick logging from the wrist for snacks and simple meals.

Glanceable insights (e.g., today’s macro breakdown, remaining goals).

Real-time nudges like “you’re trending low on protein today” or “you’re close to your calorie target.”

3. Whoop & Recovery Context

Pull recovery and strain data from Whoop.

Start to answer questions like:

“What does my best recovery days actually look like nutritionally?”

“What eating patterns correlate with poor sleep or low recovery scores?”

Move toward a performance + recovery view of nutrition, not just calorie counting.

Together, these integrations push ByteMe from “nutrition tracker” toward a personal health performance dashboard, with food as a core input.

How I Built It
Development Philosophy

I took an iterative, dogfood-heavy approach:

I am both product manager and primary user.

Features get shipped small, then adjusted based on real daily use.

If something feels annoying or slow in my real life, it gets redesigned.

This creates a tight build → use → refine loop that keeps the app grounded in real behavior instead of hypothetical personas.

Technology Stack

Mobile Application

Native iOS for tight integration and performance.

Swift for a modern, type-safe foundation.

SwiftUI for declarative UI, making it easy to evolve layouts and components as the product changes.

Data Layer

Local persistence so the app works even without a network connection (offline-first by design).

Cloud sync to back up data and support multi-device use.

Structured data models for:

Meals and food items

Macro/micro breakdowns

Goals and historical summaries

Integration Layer

Designed with HealthKit integration in mind from the start.

API abstractions in place for:

Future Whoop integrations

Potential other fitness or health services

Extensible architecture so new data sources can be added without rewriting the core app.

System Design

At a high level, the app is organized into clear layers:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           User Interface Layer          │
│    (SwiftUI – Meal Logging, Insights)   │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────┘
                   │
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────┐
│         Application Logic Layer         │
│ (Nutrition Calculation, Goal Tracking)  │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────┘
                   │
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────┐
│               Data Layer                │
│     (Local Storage + Cloud Sync)        │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────┘
                   │
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────┐
│            Integration Layer            │
│   (Future: HealthKit, Watch, Whoop)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Key Architectural Decisions

Offline-First

Logging meals should never depend on connectivity.

All core actions work locally and sync when a connection is available.

Modular Architecture

UI, business logic, data access, and integrations are cleanly separated.

New integrations (HealthKit, Whoop, Watch app) plug into the integration layer without forcing changes in UI or logic layers.

Native iOS Focus

I chose native rather than cross-platform to:

Get the best UX on iOS

Integrate deeply with Apple’s health and watch ecosystems

Avoid fighting framework limitations when doing HealthKit and WatchOS work.

Data-Driven From Day One

The data models and storage are designed with analytics and visualization in mind.

This makes it straightforward to build dashboards and trend views that actually matter to users.

What I Learned (and Brought Back to Finance)

Building and using ByteMe has directly sharpened my thinking on monitoring products in general—especially in the financial space.

A few key takeaways:

Frictionless entry is everything.
If logging a meal (or a transaction) is painful, users stop. Every second you shave off the flow matters.

Show just enough data.
Overly dense dashboards create anxiety. The right abstractions (e.g., “are you on track today?”) beat walls of charts.

Habits > features.
The job is not to expose all the data; it’s to build a loop that users will come back to daily or weekly.

Personal iteration beats hypothetical design.
Dogfooding ByteMe forced me to confront the gap between “clever” and “actually usable.”

These lessons flow straight back into my work on financial monitoring: how we present balances, how we treat trends, how we nudge people toward better behaviors without overwhelming them.

Reflection

ByteMe started as a learning experiment—a way to play with health data while thinking about finance. It’s grown into:

A real health app I rely on every day

A sandbox for monitoring UX and system ideas

A concrete example of how I blend product thinking, systems design, and hands-on building

It sits nicely alongside your other projects as:

ByteMe — where I test how to make data-driven products feel human, one meal at a time.
