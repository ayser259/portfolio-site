AI-Assisted PRD Workflow – From brain dump to structured doc

A lightweight, GenAI-powered workflow I designed to turn messy, spoken ideas into clean, structured PRDs. The system combines voice transcripts, targeted AI prompts, and guided refinement so PMs can go from “I have a half-formed idea” to “I have an update-ready PRD” in under an hour—without staring at a blank doc.

What it is: A 3-step flow that uses voice memos + custom SighedKick prompts to capture raw thinking, clarify the problem space, and generate PRD-quality drafts.

Why it matters: It reduces the blank-page tax, scales my thinking to others, and standardizes how we turn fuzzy ideas into well-formed product docs.

My role: Designed the workflow, wrote the prompt systems, and rolled it into my own and my team’s PRD habits.

Status: In active use as my default way to create & update PRDs; easily adaptable for specs, strategy docs, and one-pagers.

Overview

This “project” isn’t an app — it’s a workflow.

I designed an AI-assisted flow for updating PRDs that turns raw, spoken ideas into structured documents using:

A voice memo brain dump

A guided AI conversation to unpack and sharpen the idea

A PRD-generation prompt that turns everything into a well-structured doc

The goal: make it dramatically easier (and faster) for PMs to go from “I have a concept in my head” to “I have a PRD I can share and iterate on.”

The Problem

Traditional PRD writing has a few recurring pain points:

Blank-page paralysis – Staring at a template with empty sections is slow and demotivating.

Fragmented context – Background, member problem, business problem, and solution ideas often live in Slack threads, random docs, and people’s heads.

High switching cost – Capturing everything in polished written form is cognitively heavy, especially when you’re still figuring out the idea.

Hard to scale thinking – When you’re a principal PM, a lot of value is in your mental model of a space. Getting that out of your head in a repeatable way is non-trivial.

I wanted a flow that:

Let me think out loud instead of writing from scratch

Used GenAI as a structured thought partner, not just a text generator

Produced PRD-ready material I could drop into our canonical docs

Was simple enough that other PMs could copy it

The Solution: A 3-Step AI-Assisted PRD Flow
Step 1 – Create a transcript of your idea

Goal: Capture everything in your head without editing yourself.

Open a voice memo / recorder.

Talk as if you’re explaining this to a new teammate who needs to run with it while you’re on PTO.

Cover these beats explicitly:

Background of the product area

The member problem you’re trying to solve

The business problem you’re trying to solve

Any relevant context (history, constraints, dependencies, previous attempts)

How you want to solve it – early solution ideas, hypotheses, directions

When you’re done, save the recording and copy the transcript (from your phone or transcription tool).

This step deliberately optimizes for speed and completeness, not polish. It’s easier to talk for 10–20 minutes than to write for an hour.

Step 2 – Elevate the idea (Guided AI conversation)

Goal: Turn the raw dump into a sharper, more complete concept by letting AI interrogate it.

Take your transcript and paste it into a custom SighedKick prompt (your “Elevate the Idea” flow).

Start the conversation: the prompt asks structured questions about:

Member problem

Business problem

Success metrics

Constraints, risks, and open questions

Edge cases and dependencies

For each question:

If it’s relevant, answer it directly, adding more context.

If it’s not relevant, explicitly say “not relevant for this idea, please skip” and move on.

Keep going until:

You’ve filled in the obvious gaps

You feel like you’re not adding much new information anymore

The conversation history reads like a solid, structured understanding of the problem and approach

This step essentially replaces a chaotic internal monologue with a guided interrogation, so by the end you’ve pressure-tested and sharpened your idea without manually outlining everything yourself.

Step 3 – Generate the PRD draft

Goal: Convert the enriched conversation into a structured document you can tweak and ship.

Copy the full conversation history from Step 2 (your transcript + all Q&A).

Paste it into your second SighedKick prompt (the “Generate Document / PRD” flow).

The prompt turns that history into a structured doc, typically with sections like:

Background / Context

Member Problem

Business Problem & Opportunity

Goals & Success Metrics

Proposed Solution & Scope

Out of Scope

Dependencies & Risks

Open Questions / Next Steps

Read through the generated doc and give targeted feedback:

“Tighten the background section.”

“Add more detail on risks.”

“Shorten the proposed solution section by 30%.”

“Make the tone more concise and executive-ready.”

Once you’re happy:

Copy it section by section into your canonical PRD tool (Confluence, Google Docs, Notion, etc.).

Continue editing there if needed, or loop back through AI for small tweaks.

At the end, you have a clean PRD draft that:

Reflects your actual thinking

Follows a consistent structure

Took significantly less time than writing from scratch

How It Fits in My Work

This flow is now my default for:

New PRD drafts

Major PRD revisions or rewrites

Strategy one-pagers

Longer, structured write-ups (launch plans, retros, proposals)

It also scales nicely:

Other PMs can use the same 3-step pattern with their own recordings.

The prompts can be adapted to different templates (e.g., BRDs, experiment briefs, strategy docs).

It standardizes how we think about member vs business problems, metrics, and scope.

Design Principles Behind the Flow

Talk first, write later

Humans are often faster and more natural when speaking than typing.

Voice-first capture reduces the friction of starting.

AI as a structured interviewer

Instead of “write me a PRD,” the model acts like a thoughtful partner asking the right follow-ups.

This keeps you in control while still benefiting from AI’s structure.

Separation of thinking vs document creation

Step 2 is about thinking and refining.

Step 3 is about formatting and presenting.

Repeatable, not one-off

The links/prompts and instructions are reusable.

The flow doesn’t depend on you having a “good writing day.”

Impact & Outcomes

For me personally, this workflow has:

Cut the time to go from rough idea → PRD draft by a meaningful margin.

Reduced the blank page anxiety of starting big docs.

Improved clarity: the Q&A phase surfaces missing context, misaligned assumptions, and fuzzy problem statements.

Made it easier to keep PRDs fresh, since updates can start from a quick voice memo instead of rewriting from scratch.

At a principal level, it’s also a way to:

Codify my approach to problem framing and PRD structure.

Make that approach transferable to other PMs via prompts and process, not just ad hoc coaching.

Demonstrate concrete ways I embed GenAI into team workflows rather than just talking about AI in the abstract.

How I Describe It in One Line

A reusable, AI-assisted workflow that turns spoken idea dumps into clean, structured PRDs—so PMs can spend more time thinking and less time wrestling with a blank document.
