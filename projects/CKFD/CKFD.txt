# Demos

## What is this project?

This is a **financial monitoring and education app demo** - a living prototype that showcases various features and ideas for a comprehensive personal finance platform. Built as a React application, it serves as a visual mockup and interactive demo that can be put in front of stakeholders, users, and team members to gather feedback quickly.

The app simulates a complete financial wellness experience, featuring credit score tracking, cash flow analysis, educational content, gamification elements, and personalized financial insights. It's designed to demonstrate what a modern financial app could look like, with a focus on user engagement, education, and actionable insights.

## What is my inspiration / Why did I build this?

Sometimes building is better than talking or writing.

I like to jam on lots of ideas at work - not all of them are fully fleshed out. Having a mock version of where I think different features could be going is an easy way to get feedback quickly from execs, engineers, designers, marketers, and the most important people not in the room - the user. Every month or so I'll push some changes and update a demo app I can put in front of people.

This is a version from June.

The core philosophy behind this project is **rapid iteration and feedback**. Instead of spending weeks writing specs or creating static mockups, I can build interactive prototypes that stakeholders can actually use and experience. This approach allows me to:

- **Validate ideas quickly** - See how features feel in practice, not just on paper
- **Get real user feedback** - People can interact with the app and provide concrete feedback
- **Align cross-functional teams** - Engineers, designers, and product managers can all see the same vision
- **Iterate monthly** - Regular updates keep the demo fresh and allow for continuous refinement

## What does it do today?

The current version (June 2025) includes a comprehensive set of features that demonstrate various aspects of a financial wellness platform:

### Core Financial Tracking
- **Cash Flow Dashboard** - Visual representation of income, expenses, and net cash flow
- **Credit Score Monitoring** - Multi-agency credit score tracking (TransUnion, Equifax, Experian) with historical trends and factor analysis
- **Credit Card Utilization** - Real-time tracking of credit card usage and limits
- **Net Worth Tracking** - Overview of financial position with historical trends

### Educational & Engagement Features
- **10 Learning Modules** - Structured educational content covering various financial topics
- **Interactive Quizzes** - Gamified learning with points and progress tracking

Financial Wellness Demos – React prototypes for a modern money app

An interactive React demo that simulates a full financial wellness experience: credit scores, cash flow, education, gamification, and personalized insights. I use it as a living prototype to explore ideas for a comprehensive personal finance platform and to align stakeholders around something they can actually click through—not just read about.

What it is: A mobile-first React demo app that showcases potential features for a personal finance + education platform (credit, cash flow, learning modules, quizzes, challenges, offers, and more).

Why it matters: It lets me validate concepts quickly, gather concrete feedback from execs, designers, engineers, and users, and evolve the product vision through real interactions—not static decks.

My role: Principal PM + front-end builder — product vision, UX flows, feature set design, and React/TypeScript implementation.

Status: Continuously updated; current snapshot is from June 2025, with new ideas and experiments layered in every few weeks.

Project Detail Page
Overview

This project is a financial monitoring and education app demo—a living React prototype that shows what a modern, engaging financial wellness experience could look and feel like.

It’s not a production app; it’s a high-fidelity, interactive sandbox I use to:

Explore product directions across monitoring, education, and engagement

Align stakeholders around a tangible experience

Test content, layouts, and flows before committing real engineering resources

The demo simulates a full-stack personal finance platform, including credit tracking, cash flow, education, gamification, and personalized insights, all wrapped in a mobile-first, bottom-nav experience.

Type: Interactive demo / design & product exploration tool

Role: Vision, feature design, UX, and implementation in React + TypeScript

Tech: React, TypeScript, MUI, React Router, Vercel

Status: Updated roughly monthly; current version is June 2025

Inspiration & Philosophy

At some point I realized:

Sometimes building is better than talking or writing.

I often have a lot of ideas for where financial monitoring and education could go—new modules, patterns, and interaction models. But written specs and static Figma frames only go so far:

Stakeholders interpret the same spec differently

It’s hard to feel pacing, overload, or delight from a static mock

Users give better feedback when they can tap around something real

So I created this demo app as a rapid-iteration playground:

A place to visualize “what this could be” in a way that’s clickable and concrete

A space to try ideas that might be too early or risky for production

A shared artifact that execs, engineers, designers, marketers, and researchers can all react to

Every few weeks I ship a new version and use it to:

Validate ideas quickly — Does this flow feel intuitive? Overwhelming? Boring?

Collect real feedback — “Show me where you’d tap next” instead of “what do you think?”

Align cross-functional teams — Everyone sees the same vision, on-device

Continuously refine — Features can be added, ripped out, or reshaped with minimal overhead

The June 2025 version is one such snapshot of where my thinking currently is.

What It Does Today

The June 2025 demo includes a broad tour of what a financial wellness platform could encompass. It’s intentionally dense in features to showcase breadth, not just a single flow.

Core Financial Tracking

Cash Flow Dashboard

Visuals for income, expenses, and net cash flow over time

Emphasis on approachable, story-driven views rather than raw tables

Credit Score Monitoring

Multi-agency view (TransUnion, Equifax, Experian)

Historical trends and factor breakdowns to explain why a score looks the way it does

Credit Card Utilization

Real-time style card utilization tiles and limits

Designed to show “how close to the edge” a user is at a glance

Net Worth Tracking

Aggregated view of assets and liabilities

Simple trendline to show movement over time (up, flat, or down)

Education & Engagement

10 Learning Modules

Structured lessons on key financial topics (credit, budgeting, debt, investing basics, etc.)

Each module feels like a mini-course, not just a static article

Interactive Quizzes

Embedded quizzes tied to modules

Points/progress tracking to make learning feel like progress, not homework

Video Content

Video carousel for bite-sized financial education

Backed by JSON-based metadata to easily swap and test different content sets

Weekly Challenges

Category-specific challenges (e.g., “Spend $X less on dining out this week”)

Framed to encourage nudges and small wins, not guilt/shame

Streak Tracking

Daily engagement streaks for logins, reviews, or lesson completion

Aims to make returning to the app a habit rather than a chore

Personalized Insights & Recommendations

Blueprint Section

Conceptual area for personalized financial action plans

Think: “If your financial life were a project, here’s your next sprint.”

Debt Consolidation Suggestions

Mocked logic for surfacing potential consolidation opportunities

Demonstrates how we might explain why a recommendation makes sense

Rewards Optimization

“Are you leaving points/cashback on the table with your current card mix?”

Illustrates how card usage can be mapped to better rewards strategies

Credit Limit Opportunities

Proactive prompts about where a limit increase might be available or beneficial

Car Value Tracking

Example of pulling in a non-bank asset (vehicle) and showing how it depreciates over time

Suggested Offers

Personalized, contextual financial products, surfaced in a way that feels helpful, not spammy

Social & Community Layer

Member Spotlight

Story-driven tiles that show how others are making progress

Designed to explore the motivational power of relatable examples

News Section

Curated financial news feed

A place to experiment with how much “news” vs “evergreen content” is useful

Review System

Daily or weekly review prompts (e.g., “Take 2 minutes to review your week”)

Prototype for recurring reflection patterns, not just passive dashboards

UX & Interaction Patterns

Mobile-First Design

Bottom navigation, touch-friendly components, and progressive disclosure

Feels like a real mobile app, even when run in a browser

Responsive Layout

Adapts to various screen sizes cleanly

Material-UI Foundation

Leveraging MUI for consistent, modern components and accessible defaults

Interactive Bottom Sheets & Haptics (conceptually)

Native-feeling interaction patterns for drilling into details

Designed with an eye toward real mobile clients where haptics are supported

Where It’s Going

Because this is a demo first, the roadmap is intentionally flexible and exploratory.

Potential future directions:

Real Data Integration

Pull actual financial data via APIs (Plaid, Yodlee, etc.).

Evolve from static sample data to live-like experiences.

Advanced Analytics & ML

Predictive cash flow and risk alerts

Smart categorizations and anomaly detection (“this month doesn’t look like your usual pattern”)

Richer Goal Setting

Multi-goal systems (debt, savings, investing) with clear trade-offs

Progress timelines that feel encouraging, not discouraging

Bill Reminders & Automations

Bill calendar, notifications, and suggestions for autopay or consolidation

Investment & Tax Layers

Basic portfolio tracking

Tax-relevant insights (e.g., contribution gaps, tax-loss harvesting ideas)

Family & Shared Finances

Multi-user or “household view” support

Goals and dashboards that reflect shared realities, not just individual ones

AI-Powered Assistant

In-app conversational assistant to:

Explain trends

Answer “what if?” questions

Walk users through trade-offs

Expanded Engagement Features

Community challenges, light leaderboards

Peer learning loops without exposing sensitive data

The common theme: keep demo velocity high, keep risk low, and use this space to test big ideas before asking engineering to harden them.

Key Architectural Decisions

Component Modularity

Each conceptual feature (cash flow, quizzes, video rail, etc.) is its own component.

Self-contained logic per component makes it easy to experiment or remove a feature without breaking others.

Data-Driven Design

Central JSON/TS data files back most of the UI.

Makes it trivial to:

Swap in new quiz sets

Change copy and content

Explore different configurations without touching core UI logic

Simple Routing

Main dashboard at / for the big picture.

Detail pages for deeper dives (/credit-score, /cash-flow, /module-x, etc.).

Keeps navigation structured and easy to talk through in demos.

Local State Only (for now)

React hooks + props for state and communication.

No global state manager intentionally, to keep the demo lightweight and easy to refactor.

Styling & Design System

MUI theme customization + styleGuide.ts for:

Color palette (dark forest green primary, light greens, neutrals)

Typography rules

Spacing conventions

Ensures that as new components appear, they still feel cohesive.

Mobile-First UX Patterns

Bottom nav, bottom sheets, tabbed sections, progressive disclosure.

All oriented toward how an actual native app would feel.

Development Philosophy

This whole project is anchored on rapid prototyping and showing, not telling:

Speed over polish (early on)
Get the idea on-screen quickly, then refine based on how it actually feels.

Visual feedback
It’s easier to debate a feature once you can tap through it.

Iterate monthly
Treat the demo like a living product: each new version captures the next slice of vision.

Low operational overhead
Simple stack, simple deployment, so experimentation is cheap—in time and energy.

Reflection

These demos are where my product thinking, system design, and builder instincts meet:

They let me prototype the future of financial wellness in a safe space.

They give stakeholders something concrete to react to, which surfaces better questions.

They keep me honest: if an idea looks good in a doc but feels off in the demo, it probably needs rethinking.

In short:

This project is my “show, don’t tell” engine for financial UX and system ideas.l-UI's spacing system
- **Components**: Reusable Material-UI components with custom styling

#### Deployment

- **Platform**: Vercel
- **Build Process**: Standard Create React App build (`npm run build`)
- **Deployment**: Automatic on git push (if configured) or manual deployment
- **Hosting**: Static site hosting with client-side routing

### Development Philosophy

This project follows a **rapid prototyping** philosophy:

1. **Speed over perfection** - Get features working quickly, refine later
2. **Visual feedback** - Show, don't just tell
3. **Iterative improvement** - Monthly updates based on feedback
4. **Low overhead** - Simple tech stack, no complex infrastructure
5. **Easy updates** - Component-based architecture makes changes simple

The goal is to have a working demo that can be shared and iterated on quickly, without the complexity of a full production application. This allows for experimentation and learning without the constraints of production systems.
